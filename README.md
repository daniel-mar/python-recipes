# Python Recipes
A full stack Python application with Flask, BCrypt, MySQL workbench, SQL Tables and Wireframe.
Effort to show the relationships between Users, Recipes and Like functionality. Although there are likely better ways of achieving this effect.

I enjoy cooking and I tend to create my own spin on recipes, so I enjoy having applications that I can easily save what I need for tracking.

Allow the User to register and logs them into the dashboard to add recipes. Others can log in and like them. Only the creator of the recipe can
edit or delete recipes. 

Goal was to practice CRUD applications while also front-end and building tables/schemas.
